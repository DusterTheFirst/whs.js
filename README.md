# Code Smell in React

There's no shortage of ways to build applications with React, but one thing is for sure â€” React shines the brightest when it is used as a reactive view layer sitting on top of the state of your application. If you use it for more than that, e.g. the UI is responsible for determining when and how to load data or the UI stores certain aspects of state, this can quickly lead to code smell.

In order to keep our React projects from growing messy, we need store the application state completely outside of the UI. This will not only make our application more stable, but it will also make testing extremely simple, as we can test the UI and the state separately.
