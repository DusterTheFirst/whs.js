# Downloads
There are different ways of downloading and using the app. For the layman, you will most probably want to download the app off of
the [Apple App store][appstore] or the [Google Play Store][playstore] and recieve over-the-air (OTA) updates automatically once the
updates have been tested.

If you want to become a part of the beta program, you can join it using the [links below](#Beta).
> **BE WARNED:** when using the beta version of the app there is *NO GUARENTEE* that the app will work as intended due to hidden
bugs that may enter the program. It is your duty as a beta tester to report *any bug or problem* that you run into either through
the [Discord Server][discord] or the [Feedback Email][feedback-email].

If you would like to test even more bleeding edge features, you can also use expo release channels starting with `alpha-`.
The names follow the names of the branches of this repository 
> branch `darktheme` would be released on the expo channel `alpha-darktheme`.
